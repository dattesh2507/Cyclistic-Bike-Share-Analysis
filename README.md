# Cyclistic-Bike-Share-Analysis

First Case study research (April, 2023)

**Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?**

### Introduction

This is the first case study among the three case study I will do in my capstone project as the requirement for completion of the Google Data Analytics Certificate. As a junior data analyst in this case study I will analyse data of the fictional company called “Cyclistic” provided by the Course. To answer a business task; Cyclistic’s historical trip data is used to analyse and identify trends of the previous twelve (12) Months from April 2022 to March 2023.

### About the company
**Cyclistic** a fictional company having casual riders and members
Casual Riders are Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes and Members are Customers who purchase annual memberships 
The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.

- Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand
  tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt
  for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each
  day.

Characters and teams
- Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager.
- Cyclistic marketing analytics team
- Cyclistic executive team
  
Insights from this analysis will help the marketing team design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
